            <p>The help you continue to provide goes a long way. Some of the money has been used to feed a group of 195 refugees (some of them are children) who made their way from Luhansk (a city currently caught in the crossfire) to Chernivtsi (my hometown, in the Western part of Ukraine). These people have gone through some incredible trauma and have lost their families, become orphans, and some have significant physical and mental health issues. The money has been sent to an amazing friend of mine who is part of a volunteer group supporting these people. They have been purchasing groceries and taking turns cooking for them and delivering the food directly to the people in need. The picture shows some of the groceries purchased along with food prepared and served to people.</p>

            <p>"Hello. My name is Inna Mishalkina. I'm 38 years old. My family consist of 5 people. Me, my husband, two children (the eldest son is 15 years old and the youngest is 7) and my elderly Mom Nadia who is 68 years old. We're from Mykolaiv and stayed here through the war. We didn’t leave our city or our country since we take care of my Mom as well as my husband’s parents (Elena & Valentin) who are 84 years old and cannot move. I lost my job when the war started. My husband was drafted into military on the third day of the war. I am ongoingly searching for a job but haven’t found one yet. We really appreciate your help as all the money goes to food and medicine for the parents. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."</p>

            <p>"Dear Friends here is a story and message of gratitude from my incredible high school math teacher Oksana Proskura. Please continue to help us if you can. Every single donation no matter how small or large makes a huge difference. In this case the money you have donated helped to contribute towards a purchase of a wheelchair that Lenochka lost during the horrors of the war as well as critical medications that she requires on an ongoing basis!</p>
            <p>“I met my Lena... Tears of joy and tears! Haven’t seen each other in ages… Friends, but we brought this day closer together. Thank you to everyone who has joined the fundraiser and continues to help.</p>
            <p>Mariupol.... My own personal pain. I can finally bring myself to write about this. Almost three weeks of silence - and finally some good news: my sister is alive. Lenochka has been through a horrendous trial in her life through a nearly fatal car accident which left her disabled and in a wheelchair. Back then the chances of surviving were zero, but my sister survived and didn't lose her optimism and passion for life. Apparently, this is what saved her in Mariupol when she was in the basements for 18 days, among nearly 200 people in hell, under constant shelling and explosions. Only a miracle helped her to break out of Mariupol to the occupied territory. Her home, where every centimeter was thought out and made for her complete life in a wheelchair, was destroyed in the chaos.</p>
            <p>At first, I couldn't even share my sister's name, because her son is a border guard, and Lenochka was in the occupied territory where she was able to break out from the hell she survived in Mariupol. She has gone through so much, starting with hourly bombardments, fleeing to multiple bomb shelters, overcoming panic, and losing her vital wheelchair. Then finding herself in occupied territory, she had to face the fear of not being able to return. The incredibly challenging journey to Zaporizhye to get to Ukrainian territory involved many plans and attempts that had to be adjusted or canceled due to challenges the war created. The old car that Lenochka was being transported in sometimes would literally boil hot, or would need to be pushed as it is super old and its horsepower was not meant for this kind of lengthy journey. Once she found herself in Zaporozhye she had to get on the road again, again collecting all of her belongings and backpacks... (Can you imagine that the railway station sold Lenochka, who is in a wheelchair, a sleeping cart ticket with a top bunk bed being assigned as her seat). But the world is not without amazing people who agreed to help, exchange seats, etc.</p>
            <p>Finally I'm at the train station in Kiev, Lenochka in the cart, tears, hugs...</p>
            <p>We have decided that the best course of action at this point is to transport Lenochka abroad, because in our country in war conditions, being a person with mobility needs is expensive and scary.</p>
            <p>There is still a lot of work to be done so my sister can get to Europe for much needed care and special treatment. This hellish journey for a sister with a wheelchair can't last forever!</p>
            <p>Therefore, once again I will allow myself to thank everyone involved in helping my Lenochka.”</p>

            <p>One of the people you have helped to fund wanted me to share that she has used the money to buy much-needed medications and groceries. She now feels much more secure, knowing that she has some basic needs met for a little while given that the prices for groceries have doubled in the past few days. She wanted me to say thank you, and that she is sending blessings to you all and is wishing you all strong health and peaceful skies. Here is a picture of her and a very sweet Thank you card that she made by using a translator :) (please see the updated campaign picture) She is choosing to pay our kindness forward by lovingly receiving a family with children who was fleeing from Kiev to Romania. It is all a beautiful circle of energy.</p>
